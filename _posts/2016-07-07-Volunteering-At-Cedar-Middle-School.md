&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student at Southern Utah University(SUU), I had the opportunity to participate in a process known as experiential learning.  We were urged to explore the world off campus, and to apply oneself in the community. Throughout my time at SUU, I prepared, proposed, and completed my __EDGE__ project. The EDGE project is designed to give students a way to show how their skills can help and give back to other individuals.

## Part 1. About the Project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My EDGE project officially began in spring of 2016 when I volunteered for the music department at Cedar Middle School in Cedar City, Utah. (However, I had been volunteering since August the year prior.) I was soon given the title of "intern", and began working with the students for 5-7 hours a week. Currently, Cedar Middle School has one of the largest music programs in the state, and while I volunteered there, their top bands able to earn superior ratings at their spring festival and were even invited to perform in Salt Lake City!  About one month into my project, I was able to fit time into my schedule to volunteer once a week at Cedar High School; thus furthering my quest for more experiential education.  I was able to work with over 450 kids on a daily basis; from complete beginners to advanced musicians.  While volunteering, I relearned what it meant to love your students. As I was getting to know the students, I appreciated their devotedness towards me and to their school work. I learned their names, personalities, and little quirks that made each of the students unique.  There were days where I couldn't wait to leave my college classes to see them!  Overall, the project allowed me to see life of a music educator from the perspective of three wonderful music directors, Allan Lee, David Palmer, and Steve Shirts to whom I am indebted.  They showed me how music can bless the lives of their students and the community.  After this experience, I have grown as an educator and am privileged to become a future music instructor and mentor.

### a) First Week...surprise! 
<hr align="right"> _written January 14, 2016, edited_  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began this week by simply observing the classroom and catching on to the new semester schedule. Surprisingly, a lot of the new students recognized me from a [performance][messiah] I was in over the Christmas break.  While I was making new relationships with these students, I started rehearsing right away with students who I already knew.  Allan, David, and I had a meeting during lunch and discussed how my internship was going to play out and what they expected from me. Within the week the semester schedule was finalized.  One thing I learned about middle-school students is there ability to surprise you at any moment.  While working with a student on his clarinet, he randomly started being physical to his instrument and then myself.  Before long, the principal was called in and I was able to learn about adminstrative discipline; not something I expected to learn so quickly! On the contrary, I was delighted to find out that some of the most challenging students I taught the year prior had stayed in band because I was there to help them.  Isn't teaching wonderful?


### b) Concerts, Concerts, Concerts! 
<hr align="right"> _written May 12, 2016 edited_  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concert season is starting, and I am becoming quite comfortable now with the students and the music we are performing.  This week, we finalized our concert order and prepared for the two very large concerts.  The combined middle school bands were under my direction for _"Best Day of My Life"_ by the American Authors (just over 100 kids at once!). I also played 3rd trumpet during the concert to help those students to project their sound to the audience.  During the middle school concerts, my project was talked about to the parents of the students and they applauded my efforts.  I am thankful everyday for parents who support their child in music education, and it's a privilege to be the one passing on that knowledge.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, I was able to attend percussion, and three different wind ensemble rehearsals at Cedar High School under the direction of Steve Shirts.  Overall, I logged nearly 30 hours over the course of the semester observing and assisting one of the most successful band programs in the western united states. I was able to conduct all of the band students in _"The High School Cadets March"_ by John Phillip Sousa at their end-of-year concert.  [What an honor!][cedar-high-conducting]  I had to rehearse all of the groups separately before bring them together in a large setting.  The result wasn't a perfect performance, but the students and I had a blast performing!   


### c) Huntsman Award
<hr align="right"> _written May 20, 2016, edited_  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of my EDGE project was being able to nominate David Palmer for the Huntsman Award for Excellence.  Music educators do so much for their community, and Mr. Palmer is certainly no exception. After completing this project, I realized how difficult the life of a music director is.  In my letter of recommendation, I wrote: 
> *"  ...the overwhelming support from Mr. Palmer and other band directors has led me to pursue a career in music education. With his influence and encouragement in the classroom, he led me to where I am today. 
However, Mr. Palmer’s skills as an educator go beyond the classroom setting.  He spends countless hours repairing many damaged instruments for free, which saves the students and parents thousands of dollars and time each year.  His ability to greet his students with a happy smile and a very large “Hello” is something I admire as one who knows how stressful and tiring the job can be.  His late night grading that never seems to get done, the willingness to always help, and the service he renders to the community is remarkable and deserving of such an award."* <p>

I hope one day, I can make a difference in my student's lives.  Oddly enough, the students and teachers at both schools ended up helping me more than I to them. This EDGE project changed my life forever; how could it not?  When you are able to endow the gift of music to others, little to nothing is more gratifying.
