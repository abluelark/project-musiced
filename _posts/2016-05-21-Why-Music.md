&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I meet an individual for the first time, our conversation quickly leads to a question in the likes of, "What do you do for work?".  My answer is always, "I create music".  I feel their curiosity overwhelm them (a small pleasure of mine...) trying to come up with a coherent explanation to my puzzling response. *"Is he a musician?...composer?...street performer?...90's boy-band sensation!?* 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odds are, this individual will guess that I am some sort of musician, and that I am trying to come up with a clever, yet quaint job description.  I have yet to have someone meet me for the first time and correctly associate *creating music* with music education. As a music educator, I have the privilege of creating and sharing the gift of music with my students; this is what I consider to be the best part of my professional life. Everyday, I wake up early in the morning and never have to worry about finishing "another day at the office". My office is at the conductor's podium with a book full of wonderful music ready to be played. ...talk about a job description!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My earliest involvement with music was listening to my father's CD collection on long car trips and in the basement of my childhood home.  As a child, I carried around a portable CD player in my backpack and would steal CD's from my dad's collection to listen to.  When I turned 10, I had the opportunity to be in the local middle school band. My twin brother and I, which with we did almost everything together, were discussing which instrument we wanted to play. I strongly wanted to play percussion; my brother was anxious to play the trumpet. To say the least, we were both conflicted. As I remember it, my mother (being tired of us being indecisive) drove to the local music store and rented out 2 trumpets for my brother and I.  From that point on, I fell in love with the trumpet. In fact, I still remember learning to play *Hot Cross Buns* thinking this was the most fascinating thing I had ever done.  There wasn’t a dull moment in middle school band.  Each day we had new and exciting music to play, things to learn and new friends to be made. To this day, I still socialize with the friends I met in band!  I wasn’t even close to being the star player of the class, in fact, I remember being close to the last chair for a long time. Something inside me said, “If I can somehow play a 1st Trumpet part, I’ll be the best trumpet player in the world”. How naive of me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must know, I haven’t always known I was going to end up teaching Music. For the majority of my teenage years, and partly in college I studied to become a doctor. After studying biology in college, it didn't take long for me to find out this was *not* the career I had dreamed for. Along with the classes I had no interest in, my extenuous volunteer work at a local Emergency Room made me see an aspect of the medical field I had not thought of. I witnessed several fatalities, and I was less than “excited” to volunteer each week. I could literally feel the sadness and stress weigh on me week after week.  At one point, I felt at the point of giving up completely on life and in college.  I needed a way out. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, a career music was the obvious answer. Music is one of the few activities in my life where I feel genuinely happy. Music has great significance in my life; it has been there for me when I needed it the most.  Honestly, I would not be alive today without it!  I want music to be there for others as well. The main reason why I choose a career in music education, is to fill my desire to let students know of the significance of music in their lives. Music has been called "the great escape" because when one is playing/singing/directing music, one does not think about the test you just failed an hour ago, or the credit card you need to pay next week; you are in the present. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to say, *"I create music"* for a career makes music education instrisically rewarding. Through teaching, I give the gift of music to my students. And through music, I enrich the lives of students everywhere.
