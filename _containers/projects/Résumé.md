####SUU EDGE Project (2014-2016) : (see my [blog post](http://projectmusiced.xyz/2016/07/07/Volunteering-At-Cedar-Middle-School/) for more information)

My EDGE project officially began when I volunteered for the music department at Cedar Middle School and Cedar High School in Cedar City, Utah. I was able to work with over 450 kids on a daily basis; from complete beginners to advanced musicians in concert, small ensemble, and jazz settings.  During this time, I was able to conduct the various ensembles in 4 live concerts and 2 recordings. Overall, the project allowed me to see life of a music educator from the perspective of three wonderful music directors, Allan Lee, David Palmer, and Steve Shirts.
